This post simulates content created via Sveltia CMS that contains raw glossary terms.

The content mentions {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Aldyhn" %} and discusses the role of {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Vani" %} in the story. We also reference {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Gnark und Idin" %} as important figures, while {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Knat" %} represents competitive spirit.

This should be automatically processed by GitHub Actions when committed to main branch!
