This is a test post to verify the pre-commit hook works automatically.

When I mention {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Aldyhn" %} in this post, it should automatically become a tooltip during the commit process. The same goes for {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Vani" %} and other characters from the glossary.

Let's test with {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Knat" %} as well to make sure multiple terms are handled correctly.

This post should be automatically processed without any manual intervention!
