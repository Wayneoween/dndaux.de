This is a test post to demonstrate the custom glossary tooltips.

# Testing Glossary Tooltips

Here we can reference {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Aldyhn" %}, the goddess of wisdom, or mention {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Vani" %} in our adventures.

We can also use custom display text like {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Gnark und Idin" %}.

## Bar

This should work with GitHub Pages since it only uses Liquid includes and no custom plugins!
