This is the final test to ensure the automated pre-commit hook system is working reliably.

I'll mention several glossary terms: {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Aldyhn" %} was a powerful deity, while {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Vani" %} had different characteristics. The relationship between {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Gnark und Idin" %} was complex, and {% include glossary_tooltip.html term="Knat" %} was known for her competitive nature.

This should all be processed automatically without any manual intervention!
